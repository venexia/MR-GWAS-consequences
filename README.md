This repository contains the code to reproduce the analysis from the following paper:
  
  Walker, V., Carter, A., Gill, D., Harrison, S., Tzoulaki, S., & Davies, N. (2020). The consequences of accounting for treatment in genome-wide association studies used for two-sample Mendelian randomization

## Using this code

- The packages necessary to run this code are listed in ’dependency.R’. 
- You will need to update the script ’specify_paths_example.R’ to include the file paths to your copy of the data and save the edited script as ‘specify_paths.R’.
- The code expects to run in a directory with subdirectories 'code' (containing scripts), 'raw' (containing raw data), 'data' (where processed data are placed), and 'output' (where results are placed). 

## Availability of data

The data used in this project are available on application from UK Biobank.
